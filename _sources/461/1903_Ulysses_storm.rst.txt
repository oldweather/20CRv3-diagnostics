   MSLP Contours for v3 (left) and scout 4.6.1 (right)

   The black lines are contours of the ensemble mean. The green shading shows the uncertainty in each contour - the amount of shading shows the probability there is a contour at each location (estimated from the reanalysis ensemble). The yellow dots mark pressure observations assimilated while making the field shown.

The new observations in scout 4.6.1 come from `weatherrescue.org <https://weatherrescue.wordpress.com/2017/10/12/february-1903-the-ulysses-storm/>`_.
