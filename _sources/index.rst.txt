20CRv3 Diagnostics
==================

This is a set of analyses of the newly-released NOAA/CIRES/DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 3 (20CRv3). It compares 20CRv3 to `20CR version 2c <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/20thC_Rean/>`_, to `CERA-20C <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/archive-datasets/reanalysis-datasets/cera-20c>`_, and to `newly-digitised observations from around the British Isles <https://oldweather.github.io/DWR/>`_.

Validation against observations
-------------------------------

The `new observations rescued from the Daily Weather Reports <https://oldweather.github.io/DWR/>`_ have not yet been used by any reanalysis, so they are ideal for validation. Doing the comparison for several different times during the period covered by the new observations shows the effect of varying reanalysis and observation quality.
