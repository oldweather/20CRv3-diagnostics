Validation against observations for February 1953
=================================================

January 1853 is a case study where the reanalyses are fairly accurate (many observations assimilated), and we are validating against the UK stations where data was rescued by the `storms project <https://oldweather.github.io/DWR/data/data_from_lisa_files.html>`_.
