   MSLP Contours for v2c (left) and v3 (right)

   The thin blue lines are mslp contours from each of 56 ensemble members (all members for v2c, the first 56 members for v3). The thicker black lines are contours of the ensemble mean. The yellow dots mark pressure observations assimilated while making the field shown.

Storm :doc:`Lothar in 1999 <1999_Lothar_storm>` is the architype of a damaging European windstorm, but it might not be the worst we can expect. This storm in 1876 is called "Lothar's big brother" as it might be a useful example of an even-more-severe storm, if we can reconstruct it well enough.
