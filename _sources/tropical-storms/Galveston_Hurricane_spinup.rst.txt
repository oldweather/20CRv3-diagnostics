   MSLP Contours for the spinup stream (left) and the production stream (right)

   The thin blue lines are mslp contours from each of 56 ensemble members (the first 56 members for v3). The thicker black lines are contours of the ensemble mean. The yellow dots mark pressure observations assimilated while making the field shown. The red dots are the IBTRACS best-track observations for unnamed tropical storms - the southernmost is the `Galveston Hurricane <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane>`_.

|

Data for this period are available from two 20CRv3 streams. The production stream starting in September 1894, and a subsequent stream starting in September 1899, which is imperfectly spun-up by the date of the hurricane. This is a comparison of the two streams.
