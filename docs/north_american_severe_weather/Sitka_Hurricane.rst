   MSLP Contours for v2c (left) and v3 (right)

   The thin blue lines are mslp contours from each of 56 ensemble members (all members for v2c, the first 56 members for v3). The thicker black lines are contours of the ensemble mean. The yellow dots mark pressure observations assimilated while making the field shown. 

20CRv3 reconstructed this event twice: This is the best version, from the stream started in November 1974, and using observations from  USS Jamestown (at Sitka) the Jeannette (Arctic Ocean) and Yukon (North Pacific). The :doc:`version in the stream starting in November 1879 <Sitka_Hurricane_spinup>` is not only still spinning-up, but also does not include the  Jamestown observations.

`The "Sitka Hurricane" <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-2828-0_7>`_ was an unusually strong storm that made landfall near Sitka, in Alaska, on October 26, 1880.
