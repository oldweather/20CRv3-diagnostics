Download monthly-mean PRMSL for all ensemble members
====================================================

This data is available on the `NERSC web portal <https://portal.nersc.gov/project/20C_Reanalysis/>`_.

There is one 3.1Mb file for each of 80 ensemble menbers for each of 206 years (1806-2015). About 50Gb of data in total, and it's kept on tape at NERSC; so it will take some time to download (several hours at best).
