   MSLP Contours for v2c (left) and v3 (right)

   The thin blue lines are mslp contours from each of 56 ensemble members (all members for v2c, the first 56 members for v3). The thicker black lines are contours of the ensemble mean. The yellow dots mark pressure observations assimilated while making the field shown. The red dots are the IBTRACS best-track observations for unnamed tropical storms - the southernmost is the `Galveston Hurricane <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane>`_.

The data shown here is from the production 20CRv3 stream started in September 1894. Data for this period is also available in the subsequent stream starting in September 1899, but we expect it to be :doc:`still spinning-up <Galveston_Hurricane_spinup>`.
